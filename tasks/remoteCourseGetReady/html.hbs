      <h2>When Can I Access My Class On Canvas?</h2>

      <p>You will not see your course on Canvas until the open date (unless your professor chooses to publish it
        earlier). We will email you when it opens.</p>

      <p>Your Canvas classroom will open on:</p>

      <div class="info-box">
        <p class="key-value">
          <b class="key">Course Opens</b>
          <code class="value">{{ openDate }}</code>
        </p>
      </div>

      <h2>What is Canvas? How do I use it?</h2>

      <p>Learn more at: <a href="https://canvas.mcad.edu/orientation">https://canvas.mcad.edu/orientation</a>.</p>

      <h2>Will all of my classes be using Canvas this semester?</h2>

      <p><em>Most classes will be using Canvas LMS,</em> but some faculty have opted to continue using the legacy
        Blackboard system at <a href="https://learn.mcad.edu">https://learn.mcad.edu</a>. Faculty will let you know
        about their plans. You will also see a message in your Canvas class redirecting you to Blackboard if this is the
        case.</p>

      <h2>I have a question about my class. How do I contact my professor?</h2>

      <p>You can look up faculty and staff email on the <a href="https://intranet.mcad.edu/directory">MCAD
          Intranet Directory</a></p>

      <p>See you soon!</p>
